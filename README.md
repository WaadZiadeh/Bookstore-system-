# Bookstore system 

This project is a simple book management system for a bookstore or library. The program allows users to add, remove, search for books based on bin numbers and prices. The data is stored in arrays and persisted in a `books.txt` file. The program also includes a menu-driven interface to manage the book list interactively.

## Features
- Add a new book with bin number and price.
- Remove a book by bin number.
- Search for a book by bin number and display the price.
- Print the list of all books and their prices.
- Load book data from a file (`books.txt`).
- Save updated book data to the file.
- Uses parallel arrays for storing book information.
